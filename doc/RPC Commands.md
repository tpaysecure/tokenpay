# TokenPay RPC Commands

## anoninfo

```json
anoninfo [recalculate]
```

## anonoutputs

```json
anonoutputs [systemTotals] [show_immature_outputs]
```

## checkwallet
Check wallet for integrity.

## clearwallettransactions
Delete all transactions from wallet - reload with reloadanondata
Warning: Backup your wallet first!

## estimateanonfee

```json
estimateanonfee <amount> <ring_size> [narration]
```

<amount> is a real and is rounded to the nearest 0.000001
Used to estimate the anon fee with a given amount and ring size.


## getnewpubkey

```json
getnewpubkey [account]
```

## getnewstealthaddress

```json
getnewstealthaddress [label]
```

## getstakinginfo

## getsubsidy

```json
getsubsidy [nTarget]
```

## getwork

```json
getwork [data]
```

## getworkex

```json
getworkex [data, coinbase]
```

## help

```json
help [command]
```

## importstealthaddress

```json
importstealthaddress <scan_secret> <spend_secret> [label]
```

## liststealthaddresses

```json
liststealthaddresses [show_secrets=0]
```

List owned stealth addresses.

When used with show_secrets=1 it will return a list of all stealth addresses, the labels, the scan secrets and spend secrets.

## listtransactions

```json
listtransactions [account] [count=10] [from=0] [show_coinstake=1]
```

Returns up to [count] most recent transactions skipping the first [from] transactions for account [account].
If you want to process Stealth transactions (SDT) then you want to use this function.

There a bit of a trick necessary to get the stealth transactions, easier explained in an example:
Stealth address = "smYmoN9xyenTSow9RP4ecf172sdKTeN9k4ZVCiUhFY6MTQRqSS2LRSZSZECwnZSb1a7EaCNc4aPrmrkexBXEs4qeJTZ6m9NjJBgnQE"
=> Account name = "ao smYmoN9xyenTSow9..."

When stealth addresses are generated their account name is "ao first_16_chars...", the 3 dots at the end are important!

# General Reference

# JSON-RPC API Reference
TokenPay has many new components meaning we also added extra API calls on top of the original [Bitcoin API.](Â¶https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#bitcoin-core-apis)

- ```addmultisigaddress``` *adds a P2SH multisig address to the wallet.*
- ```addnode``` *attempts to add or remove a node from the addnode list, or to try a connection to a node once.*
- ```backupwallet``` *safely copies `wallet.dat`<!--noref--> to the specified file, which can be a directory or a path with filename.*
- ```createmultisig``` *creates a P2SH multi-signature address.*
- ```createrawtransaction``` *creates an unsigned serialized transaction that spends a previous output to a new output with a P2PKH or P2SH address. The transaction is not stored in the wallet or transmitted to the network.*
- ```decoderawtransaction``` *decodes a serialized transaction hex string into a JSON object describing the transaction.*
- ```decodescript``` *decodes a hex-encoded P2SH redeem script.*
- ```dumpprivkey``` *returns the wallet-import-format (WIP) private key corresponding to an address. (But does not remove it from the wallet.)*
- ```dumpwallet``` *creates or overwrites a file with all wallet keys in a human-readable format.*
- ```encryptwallet``` *encrypts the wallet with a passphrase.  This is only to enable encryption for the first time. After encryption is enabled, you will need to enter the passphrase to use private keys.*

Once a payment has been received to an address, future calls to this RPC for the same account will return a different address.*
- ```getaddednodeinfo``` *returns information about the given added node, or all added nodes (except onetry nodes). Only nodes which have been manually added using the `addnode` RPC will have their information displayed.*
