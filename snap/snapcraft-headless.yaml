# CLI only, no GUI. Managed to build this on a Raspberry Pi 3
# as well. So this builds cleanly on armhf, and x86_64

summary: TokenPay wallet headless
description: |
  TokenPay is a decentralized and self-verifying payment platform project. Based entirely on mathematics
  it is designed to enable secure transactions between multiple parties. With maximum user security as
  the focal point, the system is accessed exclusively through the encrypted Tor Browser. Transactions are
  conducted with its own proprietary and untraceable digital asset called TPAY that is embedded with the
  latest and most advanced safety features. These characteristics include a stealth addressing system,
  encrypted messaging, completely anonymous trading and a uniquely designed hashing algorithm that enables
  fast and secure confirmations under any conditions.
